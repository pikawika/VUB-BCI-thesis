# First meeting - 28/09/2021

On the 28th of September, *a first formal meeting* took place between Lennert and the three (co-)supervisors. The full list of attendees can be found on [the attendee list](#attendees). This meeting mainly consisted of talking about the **schedule for the first semester** and **some general pointers** for the master thesis.

## Contents of the meeting

### Having realistic expectations and deadlines

All three supervisors emphasized it is important to remember that the master thesis is **only a one academic year project**. Whilst this sound like a lot of time, it actually isn't considering a high quality, scientific-grade paper is expected. The scientific part is something that should not be forgotten, **the literature review and other scientific aspects of the paper are *really important*.**

Due to Lennert's first semester containing other course lectures, it is important to have a realistic goal for the first semester. The following things were discussed to be explored **in the first semester**:

- A **literature review** that is 90% done as proposed by Geraint.
  - Only additions of relevant literature found needed during the second semester should be added.
  - Kevin found this a tough challenge for only three months, but most of his master thesis students are 2-year students. Geraint said it's the normal deadline for most dinf students.
- A **framework project** as proposed by Arnau.
  - A working framework by following an existing framework. Nothing fancy yet.
  - Should be possible to change the pipeline thus a modular design is required.
  - Model choice and input data should be easily replaceable.
  - May be as simple as following an existing tutorial.



### Read, read some more and then some

**Reading, reading and more reading**. That's the main takeaway of the first meeting. The following was proposed:

- **Find relevant papers** in a somewhat schematic manner.
  - Not completely, as this would take too much time, but remember the search terms used and save them. Also, keep track of the papers you've read with more than just bib entries.
- Make an **old-school table** for each paper and a set of topics
  - This way you can see the blank fields for certain topics (e.g. topics that are not handled by a lot of papers)
  - You can also quickly read summaries of each topic by each paper to get a glimpse of what is important to tell in your paper
- Find the **appropriate algorithm for the data**
  - Don't use just any type of deep learning but think about the model you use
  - Geraint said to look into DeepMind WaveNet.
- Use **good software**
  - Zotero for bib management
  - Connected papers for finding related papers
  - LaTeX for writing the thesis



### Known pitfalls

Geraint discussed many pitfalls one might occur during a master thesis and how they can be tackled. The following things are most noteworthy:

- Things will take longer than you expect, ***keep it simple***.
- Don't postpone things since the deadline seems so far away, *try to work on your master thesis **at least 15 minutes a day***.
- If you want to research with data from external people
  - *think about the usefulness*, can you take those external people to your defence for demonstration purposes? If not, **using existing data is just as good most likely**.
  - you need *approval from the ethical committee which takes time*.

## Summary

The main takeaway from this first meeting is that one should not underestimate the time that will go into creating a *good master thesis*. It is also very possible ***things will go wrong***. To combat this, a *plan b* or even a *plan c* should be thought of. **Negative results can be more helpful and insightful than good ones**.
