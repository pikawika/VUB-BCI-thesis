## Contents of the meeting

### Making a components diagram

- It was recommended to make a components diagram.
- This component diagram would give insight into what is needed for the system and keep track of the progress.
- Would aid in giving an overview to promotor and (co)-supervisors what I am talking about and working on.


### Focusing on MVP first

- Whilst I was thinking about a lot of things already, which is nice and should be mentioned in the thesis, it is important to get the MVP to work first.
  - MVP is 2 movements, four actions:
    - Left-hand squeeze: left turn.
    - Right-hand squeeze: right turn.
    - Both hands squeeze: move forward.
    - No hands squeeze: brake.


### Other things

- It was again repeated that time is limited and postponing is something you should try to avoid as much as possible.
- Upload annotated PDF's to Zotero for literature review.
- Try to have some code working by the next meeting - e.g. replication of existing paper.
