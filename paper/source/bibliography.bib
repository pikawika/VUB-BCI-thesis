	abstract     = {Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. In this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN), which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for any domain-specific knowledge or calibration data. We report across subject mean accuracy of approximately 80\% (chance being 8.3\%) and show this is substantially better than current state-of-the-art hand-crafted approaches using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, we analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation, discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude related features associated with the structure of the dataset. We discuss how our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g., asynchronous BCI) as well as provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.},

	abstract     = {Brain computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available. We demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks, suggesting that the observed performances were not due to artifact or noise sources in the data.},

	abstract     = {"In recent years, dozens of neuro-self-help books have been published that all purport to help improve brain function with just "one weird trick." With lifestyle changes, recreational drug use, prescription interventions, or the latest in fashionable electromagnetic stimulation, we can lightly embroider, severely alter, or dramatically deconstruct the brains we have. In The Tailored Brain, biologist and science writer Emily Willingham takes a different approach. There is no trick. No prescription drug, perfect diet, or just-right dose of psychedelic is going to transform your mind and life forever. But there are ways to assess yourself inside and out and tailor an approach that is just right for you. This book looks at the realities of popular self-help and brain-tailoring promises, from cannabidiol to special diets to electromagnetic stimulation, and how they can (and cannot) produce results. Willingham offers clear, actionable guidance on how treatments for epilepsy and mania might improve focus, why magnetic stimulation might help your depression, and whether microdosing really improves creativity. TK also takes stock of what's outside your mind-your environment, including the people, places, and things - and explores how cultivating meaningful social relationships and a strong sense of community may help you think more clearly than any drug could. But even if we can tailor our brains, should we? Brain tailoring can often look like a plan for making your brain work the "right" way. Yet the idiosyncrasies and "flaws" we might perceive in our cognition are often not really flaws at all; they are different ways of thinking that contribute to the creativity and resilience of the human race. This book is unique in that Willingham also offers ways for readers to think through whether they want to tailor their brains to become something we want to be, something society expects us to be, or something we can't be because society doesn't give us the support we need. You and you alone can decide how your brain should function. Packed with real-life examples and checklists that allow readers to assess their cognitive needs and decide on useful alterations, The Tailored Brain is the definitive guide to a better brain"--},

	abstract     = {Measurement of neural tracking of natural running speech from the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an increasingly popular method in auditory neuroscience and has applications in audiology. The method involves decoding the envelope of the speech signal from the EEG signal, and calculating the correlation with the envelope of the audio stream that was presented to the subject. Typically EEG systems with 64 or more electrodes are used. However, in practical applications, set-ups with fewer electrodes are required. Here, we determine the optimal number of electrodes, and the best position to place a limited number of electrodes on the scalp. We propose a channel selection strategy based on an utility metric, which allows a quick quantitative assessment of the influence of a channel (or a group of channels) on the reconstruction error. We consider two use cases: a subject-specific case, where the optimal number and position of the electrodes is determined for each subject individually, and a subject-independent case, where the electrodes are placed at the same positions (in the 10-20 system) for all the subjects. We evaluated our approach using 64-channel EEG data from 90 subjects. In the subject-specific case we found that the correlation between actual and reconstructed envelope first increased with decreasing number of electrodes, with an optimum at around 20 electrodes, yielding 29\% higher correlations using the optimal number of electrodes compared to all electrodes. This means that our strategy of removing electrodes can be used to improve the correlation metric in high-density EEG recordings. In the subject-independent case, we obtained a stable decoding performance when decreasing from 64 to 22 channels. When the number of channels was further decreased, the correlation decreased. For a maximal decrease in correlation of 10\%, 32 well-placed electrodes were sufficient in 91\% of the subjects.},

	abstract     = {We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

	abstract     = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

	abstract     = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},
