\section{Introduction to this chapter}
\label{sec:biomedical_signals_introduction}
% NOTE: "Introduction" exists in each chapter and gives short intro to chapter + what can be expected in chapter

Whilst Chapter \ref{ch:bci} has provided an in-depth intuitive introduction to \glspl{bci}, some more technical aspects need addressing as well to provide a computer scientist with all of the required foundational knowledge for \gls{bci} research.
This chapter provides the required technical knowledge on the data that \gls{bci} systems use, brain signals.
Brain signals are only one of the many types of \gls{biosignal} present in the human body.
Whilst from a computer scientist's perspective brain signals may just be another type of input data to a classification model, having at least a basic understanding of this data is crucial in making good classification algorithms.
Even when using \gls{dl} approaches where no manual feature engineering has to be done and where basic models without much thought may have pleasing results, understanding the data will allow for the creation of better models.
This understanding of the data also helps in troubleshooting why some models may not have the desired results.

To provide this basic understanding, this chapter starts by discussing \glspl{biosignal} in general.
It is discussed what \glspl{biosignal} are and where they originate from in the human body.
After this general discussion on \glspl{biosignal}, a focus is put on the different \glspl{biosignal} from the human brain, with brain signals measured using \gls{eeg} in particular.
This \gls{eeg} measuring technique and other measuring techniques are also discussed in greater detail.
Whilst it is addressed that \gls{eeg} has some fundamental shortcomings over other measuring modalities, it also has some attractive properties over these alternatives.
These attractive properties are listed and provide an argument as to why the remainder of this master thesis will focus on \gls{eeg} and \gls{mi} \gls{eeg} in particular.

\section{Biosignals in the human body}
\label{sec:biomedical_signals_biosignals_in_human}

\Glspl{biosignal} can be defined as any signal produced by living organisms, such as humans and animals, that can be constantly measured and monitored.
\Glspl{biosignal} can be produced by different energy forms, such as electrical and chemical energy.
Table \ref{tab:biomedical_signals_energy_forms} summarizes some of these energy forms and which type of \glspl{biosignal} they can produce.
Whilst living beings, including humans, produce many different types of \glspl{biosignal}, this master thesis will only consider time-varying electrical \glspl{biosignal}.
These types of \glspl{biosignal}, sometimes reffered to as \textit{bioelectrical signals}, are the ones used as input data for \gls{bci} systems.
\Citet{biosignal_definition} discusses all different types of \glspl{biosignal} in greater detail.

\Gls{mi} is the process in which a person generates brain-activity in the motor cortex merely by imagining motor movements.
\Gls{mi}-based \glspl{bci} are interesting because they don't require any external stimulus nor effective motor movements

\glspl{erp} and the measurable signals they produce, such as the P300 signal, are only one of many sources for detectable brain signals.
In general, \gls{erp} related signals are easier to detect reliably, as the stimulus can be controlled, giving a hint when and where to look for signals and what to look for.

An alternative to \glspl{erp} is using a mental phenomenon called \gls{mi} as source of signals for a \gls{bci} system.
\Gls{mi} is the process in which a person generates brain activity in the motor cortex merely by imagining motor movements.
Section \ref{subsec:biomedical_signals_from_brain_inducing_methods} explains in further detail how \gls{mi} is not dependent on an external stimuli nor actual motor movements.
This makes \gls{mi}-based \glspl{bci} extra appealing as they don't require external stimuli and are applicable for people with motor disabilities.
\Citet{first_mi} were the first to experiment with the idea of using \gls{mi} in an \gls{eeg} classification task.
Since then, many \gls{mi}-based \glspl{bci} have been proposed.

% There is a wide variety in the devices used for the acquisition of each signal. For EEG, the number of recorded channels (electrodes) varies from a single channel to 64 channels, with sampling frequencies ranging from 128 to 1000 Hz.

% uit bci_review_arnau

Many comparisons between different types of measuring equipment, often with greatly differing costs, have already been made \citep{bci_cheap_viability1, bci_cheap_viability2, bci_cheap_viability3, bci_cheap_viability4, bci_cheap_viability5}.
The main consensus is that the cheaper consumer-grade equipment has the potential to reach similar performance of a conventional, often medical-grade, BCI system.
These results are promising but due to the controlled nature of the experiments, they might not reflect real-life applications accurately.
As discussed before, the user experience of a \gls{bci} system is as important if not more important then the raw performance of the system.

% OpenBCI1 is an open-source, versatile and affordable biosensing system which can be used to acquire not only EEG signals but also to measure electrical activity of muscle (EMG) and heart (ECG). All OpenBCI boards are based on the open-source electronic platform Arduino with wireless connection to the computer. OpenBCI offers a variety of low-cost amplifiers (boards), electrode systems (e.g. 3D-printed headware) and a software for viewing and recording the biosignals (OpenBCI GUI).2

% ecog: Modalities include the electrocorticogram where electrodes are implanted on the top of the cortex, right under the skull. There is also the possibility to implant electrodes directly in the brain matter (intracortical EEG) to further increase SNR and spatial resolution. However, such invasive approaches fall outside of the scope of this article.

% Alternative signals include magnetoencephalogram (Gross 2019), functional near infrared spectroscopy (Naseer and Hong 2015), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Sitaram et al 2007). Lesser known signal types are also becoming usable, such as acoustic resonance (Norman et al 2021), which uses the Doppler effect to detect changes in brain activity, and Photoplethysmogram (Han et al 2020), which uses optical reflections to monitor brain activity, in a similar way to near infrared spectroscopy. Another possibility is to monitor spinal cord activity using magnetospinography (Sakakiet al 2020) if one is only interested in lower-limb activity

Research by \citet{human_eeg_discovery} is the first in describing the measurement of brain waves from the human skull in a non-invasive manner.
Because of this, the German neuroscientist and psychiatrist Hans Berger is often seen as the inventor of \gls{eeg}.
Whilst he was one of the first to use the term \textit{elektrenkephalogramm}, it was Richard Caton who first described the findings of brain waves in general.
He found this phenomena in animal brains as early as 1875 \citep{first_eeg}.
Since then, \gls{eeg} methodology and equipment has matured and evolved a lot.
