\chapter{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}

This master thesis explores the viability of real world applications using classification algorithms on live \gls{eeg} measures collected from affordable \glspl{bci}.
Firstly, an introductory chapter discusses why, where and how systems using such cerebral activity are being used.
The gain in popularity and affordability of such systems has also given rise to serious ethical questions, some of which this thesis addresses.
Secondly, required background knowledge on \glspl{biosignal} and how to process them is given.
An overview on the most commonly used \gls{ml} algorithms for classifying \gls{eeg} measured \glspl{biosignal} is presented.
Following the discussion of the required processing steps for a \gls{biosignal} and most commonly used \gls{ml} classification techniques, a generalised \gls{bci} pipeline is proposed.
The components of this pipeline can be easily interchanged and used both in an offline as online setting.
