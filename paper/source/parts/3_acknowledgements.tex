I'm extremely grateful to both my supervisor Prof. Dr. Geraint Wiggins and advisor Mr. Arnau Dillen for allowing me to write this thesis with a subject tailored to my interests.
This thesis would not have been possible without their helpful advise, constructive criticism and insightful suggestions.
Their patients cannot be underestimated and the organised biweekly meetings were simply invaluable.
I must also thank Prof. Dr. Jef Vandemeulebroucke for teaching both the biomedical signals and imaging course as well as the clinical decision support systems course.
The contents of these courses has contributed to a better understanding on some of the physical phenomena and used technologies addressed in this thesis.
Iâ€™d also like to recognize the statistical and writing expertise gained through the methods of scientific research course by Prof. Dr. Bart de Boer.
Lastly, I gratefully acknowledge the unparalleled support of my girlfriend, parents and friends throughout the sometimes stressful process of this master thesis.
