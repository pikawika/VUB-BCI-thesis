\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:acknowledgements}


I'm extremely grateful to both my supervisor Professor Doctor Geraint Wiggins and my advisor Arnau Dillen for allowing me to write this thesis on a subject that is tailored to my interests.
This thesis would not have been possible without their helpful advice, constructive criticism and insightful suggestions.
I would like to thank them especially for bearing with me through a master thesis process that was filled with ups and downs.
In this regard, I must also thank my girlfriend, parents and friends for their unparalleled support throughout this sometimes stressful process.
I must also thank Professor Doctor Jef Vandemeulebroucke for teaching both the biomedical signals and imaging course as well as the clinical decision support systems course.
The contents of these courses have contributed to a better understanding of some of the physical phenomena and used technologies addressed in this master thesis.
I'd also like to recognize the statistical and writing expertise gained through the methods of scientific research course by Professor Doctor Bart de Boer.
