## Documentation

To make reproducing the project easier, the following documentation is provided.

### Installation instructions

OpenBCI hardware and software works best on Windows. Some software, such as OpenViBE, doesn't even support macOS. The use of a Windows machine or VM is thus recommended. The software for this master thesis was mainly developed on a Windows 10 machine. Reproducibility on other operating systems can't be guaranteed.

- Install instructions for macOS can be found [here](documentation/installation/macos.md) (NOT RECOMMENDED).

### Meeting summaries

Multiple formal and informal meetings were held during the development of this project. Small summaries for each of those meetings can be found in their markdown files.
