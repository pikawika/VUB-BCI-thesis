## Documentation

To make reproducing the project easier, the following documentation is provided.

### Installation instructions

OpenBCI hardware and software works best on Windows. Some software, such as OpenViBE, doesn't even support macOS. The use of a Windows machine or VM is thus recommended. The software for this master thesis was mainly developed on a Windows 10 machine. Reproducibility on other operating systems can't be guaranteed.

| Title                                            | Documentation                                           |

## Code

To make reproducing the project easier, all of the code used is provided.

### Utils

Some util files are provided to extract certain aspects from the main notebooks such as data retrieval.

### Experimental notebooks

Some of the code written is not used explicitly in the paper but was used to gain information. We call these experimental notebooks. The following experimental notebooks are available:

## Literature review

The literature review is one of the most important aspects of any scientific paper. To better understand the complex topic of BCIs, both scientific papers and more informal sources were consulted. In the table below some of these sources and their synthesis are given. A list of all sources used for the master thesis is available through the literature tools, more on this [here](side-information/software/literature_tools.md).


### Scientific sources

As this master thesis should be scientific grade, the sources should also be scientific. Finding good sources isn't an easy task since there are so many to choose from. Luckily Arnau Dillen and Geraint Wiggins gave some great pointers on where to begin and how to proceed. Per the recommendation of Geraint Wiggins, an overview sheet of all these sources was made. The table below gives an overview of the most interesting scientific sources and the notes made for them.

| Title                                                        | Type                                                         | Notes                                                        |

### Informal sources

There are a lot of interesting YouTube videos, blog posts and more about the thesis topic, especially about OpenBCI. They are insightful to understand how the different aspects work in real life. However, these sources are not peer-reviewed and thus don't have much scientific value. The table below gives an overview of the most interesting ones and the notes made for them.

| Title                             | Type                                                         | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Testing Brain-Computer Interfaces | Youtube video by [James Bruton - 1M subs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUbDcUPed50Y_7KmfCXKohA) | Notes available [here](literature-review/informal/youtube/james_bruton-testing_BCIs.md) |
