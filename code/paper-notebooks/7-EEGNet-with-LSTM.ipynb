    "# EEGNet with LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a modified reimplementation of the previously tested CNN-based EEG classifiers:\n",
    "   - EEGNet by [Lawhern et al](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/177/EEGNet_lstm/1-2552/aace8c/meta).\n",
    "      - Modifications to make it better suited for short-length windows\n",
    "      - Memory is added after the \"feature extraction\" layers, the CNN layers, in the form of a LSTM layer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works in an offline fashion and uses epochs with a length of 3 seconds.\n",
    "This epoch starts 1 second before the visual queue was given, includes the 1 second the visual queue was shown and ends 1 second after the visual queue was hidden, totalling 3 seconds.\n",
    "No baseline correction was performed and the raw EEG data was used.\n",
    "The effective training and testing are done in a half-second window, starting 0.1 seconds after the start of the visual queue.\n",
    "A window of 0.5 seconds was chosen as it is a common size for sliding window approaches in online systems.\n",
    "Some alternatives to this setup were also considered, including one alternative performed for all experiment which uses a long, 1.5 seconds, window.\n",

    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "A classifier may be trained on a singular subject, using a singular session and testing on that same session.\n",
    "This is an over-optimistic testing scenario and has a great risk of overfitting with poor generalisation to new sessions or new subjects but can be an okay baseline test to see if *at least something* can be learned.\n",

    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the last recorded session of each of these participants, thus the one where the participant has the most experience\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We split the data in a train/test dataset with 20% test data balanced over all MI classes\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model with memory provided through the `EEGNet_with_lstm.py` util file with the following settings:\n",

    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "A classifier may be trained on a singular subject, using a singular session and testing on that same session.\n",

    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the last recorded session of each of these participants, thus the one where the participant has the most experience\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We split the data in a train/test dataset with 20% test data balanced over all MI classes\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",

    "## Same subject, new session: EEGNet bidirectional LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "A classifier may be trained on a singular subject, but by using one or more sessions for training and testing on a new, unseen session.\n",
    "This is a harder task than the previous one, where training and testing were done for the same session.\n",
    "This section will train the same classifiers for the same participants as before but by using the first two datasets as training data and the third and final session of each participant as a standalone test set which is not used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment works as follows:\n",
    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the first two recorded session of each of these participants for training and the last for testing.\n",
    "      - Thus, the CV scores are on the test split for the training data whilst the independent test set is from the unseen session not used during training. This avoids data leakage.\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model with memory provided through the `EEGNet_with_lstm.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (int, number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG dat)\n",
    "         - Samples = 100 (number of time points in the EEG data - default: 128)\n",
    "         - dropoutRate = 0.5 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - kernLength = 50 (length of temporal convolution in first layer. Suggested: half the sampling rate - default: 64)\n",
    "         - F1 = 8 (number of temporal filters - default: 8)\n",
    "         - F2 = 16 (number of pointwise filters - default: 16)\n",
    "         - D = 2 (number of spatial filters to learn within each temporal convolution - default: 2)\n",
    "         - norm_rate = 0.25 (Normalisation rate - default: 0.25)\n",
    "         - dropoutType = 'SpatialDropout2D' (Either SpatialDropout2D or Dropout, passed as a string - default: Dropout)\n",
    "         - LSTM_size = 64\n",
    "         - lstm_dropout = 0.6\n",
    "         - lstm_l1 = 0.0005\n",
    "         - lstm_l2 = 0.0005\n",
    "      - We trained for 2500 epochs due to the increased amount of data, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.3 validation split)\n",
    "   - We record the validation accuracy and loss over time for monitoring the training and test on the seperate test set"

    "## Same subject, new session: EEGNet with bidirectional ConvLSTM2D\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "A classifier may be trained on a singular subject, but by using one or more sessions for training and testing on a new, unseen session.\n",
    "This is a harder task than the previous one, where training and testing were done for the same session.\n",
    "This section will train the same classifiers for the same participants as before but by using the first two datasets as training data and the third and final session of each participant as a standalone test set which is not used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment works as follows:\n",
    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the last recorded session of each of these participants, thus the one where the participant has the most experience\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We split the data in a train/test dataset with 20% test data balanced over all MI classes\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model with memory provided through the `EEGNet_with_lstm.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (int, number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG dat)\n",

    "         - dropoutRate = 0.5 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - kernLength = 50 (length of temporal convolution in first layer. Suggested: half the sampling rate - default: 64)\n",

    "      - We trained for 500 epochs due to the increased training time, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.25 validation split - equal size as true test split)\n",

    "## New subject: EEGNet bidirectional LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "Perhaps the hardest task is training a classifier on data from one or more subjects, but using it to classify data from a completely new user.\n",
    "This is the hardest task we'll discuss.\n",
    "This section will train the same classifiers for the same participants as before but by using one participant for testing and the other two for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment works as follows:\n",
    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use one participant's data for testing and the other two participant's data for training\n",
    "      - Thus, the CV scores are on the test split for the training data whilst the independent test set is from the unseen subject not used during training. This avoids data leakage.\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model with memory provided through the `EEGNet_with_lstm.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (int, number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG dat)\n",
    "         - Samples = 100 (number of time points in the EEG data - default: 128)\n",
    "         - dropoutRate = 0.5 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - kernLength = 50 (length of temporal convolution in first layer. Suggested: half the sampling rate - default: 64)\n",
    "         - F1 = 8 (number of temporal filters - default: 8)\n",
    "         - F2 = 16 (number of pointwise filters - default: 16)\n",
    "         - D = 2 (number of spatial filters to learn within each temporal convolution - default: 2)\n",
    "         - norm_rate = 0.25 (Normalisation rate - default: 0.25)\n",
    "         - dropoutType = 'SpatialDropout2D' (Either SpatialDropout2D or Dropout, passed as a string - default: Dropout)\n",
    "         - LSTM_size = 64\n",
    "         - lstm_dropout = 0.6\n",
    "         - lstm_l1 = 0.0005\n",
    "         - lstm_l2 = 0.0005\n",
    "      - We trained for 1000 epochs due to the increased training time compared to EEGNet and the fast convergence, knowing it would overfit pretty quickly, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.25 validation split - equal size as true test split)\n",
    "   - We record the validation accuracy and loss over time for monitoring the training and test on the seperate test set\n"

    "## New subject: EEGNet with bidirectional ConvLSTM2D\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "Perhaps the hardest task is training a classifier on data from one or more subjects, but using it to classify data from a completely new user.\n",
    "This is the hardest task we'll discuss.\n",
    "This section will train the same classifiers for the same participants as before but by using one participant for testing and the other two for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment works as follows:\n",
    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use one participant's data for testing and the other two participant's data for training\n",
    "      - Thus, the CV scores are on the test split for the training data whilst the independent test set is from the unseen subject not used during training. This avoids data leakage.\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model with memory provided through the `EEGNet_with_lstm.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (int, number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG dat)\n",
    "         - Samples = 100 (number of time points in the EEG data - default: 128)\n",
    "         - dropoutRate = 0.5 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - kernLength = 50 (length of temporal convolution in first layer. Suggested: half the sampling rate - default: 64)\n",
    "         - F1 = 8 (number of temporal filters - default: 8)\n",
    "         - F2 = 16 (number of pointwise filters - default: 16)\n",
    "         - D = 2 (number of spatial filters to learn within each temporal convolution - default: 2)\n",
    "         - norm_rate = 0.25 (Normalisation rate - default: 0.25)\n",
    "         - dropoutType = 'SpatialDropout2D' (Either SpatialDropout2D or Dropout, passed as a string - default: Dropout)\n",
    "         - lstm_filters = 40\n",
    "         - lstm_kernel_size = 9\n",
    "         - ltsm_dropout = 0.7\n",
    "         - ltsm_l1 = 0.00005\n",
    "         - ltsm_l2 = 0.00005\n",
    "      - We trained for 500 epochs due to the increased training time, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.25 validation split - equal size as true test split)\n",
    "   - We record the validation accuracy and loss over time for monitoring the training and test on the seperate test set\n"
