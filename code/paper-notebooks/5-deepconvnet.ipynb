    "This notebook provides a modified reimplementation of the popular CNN-based EEG classifier: DeepConvNet by [Schirrmeister et al](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23730).\n",
    "Most modifications include parameter changes to make it better suited for our data.\n",
    "The knowledge and utilities obtained from experimental notebooks six and seven are used throughout this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works in an offline fashion and uses epochs with a length of 3 seconds.\n",
    "This epoch starts 1 second before the visual queue was given, includes the 1 second the visual queue was shown and ends 1 second after the visual queue was hidden, totalling 3 seconds.\n",
    "No baseline correction was performed and the raw EEG data was used.\n",
    "The effective training and testing are done in a half-second window, starting 0.1 seconds after the start of the visual queue.\n",
    "A window of 0.5 seconds was chosen as it is a common size for sliding window approaches in online systems.\n",
    "Some alternatives to this setup were also considered, including one alternative performed for all experiment which uses a long, 1.5 seconds, window.\n",

    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the last recorded session of each of these participants, thus the one where the participant has the most experience\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We split the data in a train/test dataset with 20% test data balanced over all MI classes\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for DeepConvNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model provided through the `EEGModels.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG data)\n",

    "         - dropoutRate = 0.6 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - conv_filters = 4 (Conv2D kernel size - default: 5, paper: 10)\n",
    "         - strides = 2 (Stride size for average pooling layer - default: 2, paper: 3)\n",
    "         - pool_size = 2 (Pool size for average pooling layer - default: 2, paper: 3)\n",
    "      - We trained for 2500 epochs, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.25 validation split - equal size as true test split)\n",

    "## Same subject, new session\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "A classifier may be trained on a singular subject, but by using one or more sessions for training and testing on a new, unseen session.\n",
    "This is a harder task than the previous one, where training and testing were done for the same session.\n",
    "This section will train the same classifiers for the same participants as before but by using the first two datasets as training data and the third and final session of each participant as a standalone test set which is not used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment works as follows:\n",
    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the first two recorded session of each of these participants for training and the last for testing.\n",
    "      - Thus, the CV scores are on the test split for the training data whilst the independent test set is from the unseen session not used during training. This avoids data leakage.\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model provided through the `EEGModels.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (int, number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG dat)\n",
    "         - Samples = 100 (number of time points in the EEG data - default: 128)\n",
    "         - dropoutRate = 0.5 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - kernLength = 50 (length of temporal convolution in first layer. Suggested: half the sampling rate - default: 64)\n",
    "         - F1 = 8 (number of temporal filters - default: 8)\n",
    "         - F2 = 16 (number of pointwise filters - default: 16)\n",
    "         - D = 2 (number of spatial filters to learn within each temporal convolution - default: 2)\n",
    "         - norm_rate = 0.25 (Normalisation rate - default: 0.25)\n",
    "         - dropoutType = 'SpatialDropout2D' (Either SpatialDropout2D or Dropout, passed as a string - default: Dropout)\n",
    "      - We trained for 2500 epochs, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.25 validation split - equal size as true test split)\n",
    "   - We record the validation accuracy and loss over time for monitoring the training and test on the seperate test set\n",

    "## New subject\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the master's thesis, training and testing a classification system can happen using multiple strategies.\n",
    "Perhaps the hardest task is training a classifier on data from one or more subjects, but using it to classify data from a completely new user.\n",
    "This is the hardest task we'll discuss.\n",
    "This section will train the same classifiers for the same participants as before but by using one participant for testing and the other two for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment works as follows:\n",
    "   - We use participants with at least three recordings\n",
    "      - Participants: B, C, E\n",
    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use one participant's data for testing and the other two participant's data for training\n",
    "      - Thus, the CV scores are on the test split for the training data whilst the independent test set is from the unseen subject not used during training. This avoids data leakage.\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
    "      - We used the modified EEGNet model provided through the `EEGModels.py` util file with the following settings:\n",
    "         - nb_classes = 3 (int, number of classes to classify)\n",
    "         - Chans = 21 (number of channels in the EEG dat)\n",
    "         - Samples = 100 (number of time points in the EEG data - default: 128)\n",
    "         - dropoutRate = 0.5 (dropout fraction - default: 0.5)\n",
    "         - kernLength = 50 (length of temporal convolution in first layer. Suggested: half the sampling rate - default: 64)\n",
    "         - F1 = 8 (number of temporal filters - default: 8)\n",
    "         - F2 = 16 (number of pointwise filters - default: 16)\n",
    "         - D = 2 (number of spatial filters to learn within each temporal convolution - default: 2)\n",
    "         - norm_rate = 0.25 (Normalisation rate - default: 0.25)\n",
    "         - dropoutType = 'SpatialDropout2D' (Either SpatialDropout2D or Dropout, passed as a string - default: Dropout)\n",
    "      - We trained for 2500 epochs, saving the best model based on best validation accuracy and validation loss (0.25 validation split - equal size as true test split)\n",
    "   - We record the validation accuracy and loss over time for monitoring the training and test on the seperate test set\n",
