    "This notebook provides a modified reimplementation of the previously tested CNN-based EEG classifiers:\n",
    "   - EEGNet by [Lawhern et al](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aace8c/meta).\n",
    "      - Modifications to make it better suited for short-length windows\n",
    "      - Memory is added after the \"feature extraction\" layers, the CNN layers, in the form of a LSTM layer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works in an offline fashion and uses epochs with a length of 3 seconds.\n",
    "This epoch starts 1 second before the visual queue was given, includes the 1 second the visual queue was shown and ends 1 second after the visual queue was hidden, totalling 3 seconds.\n",
    "No baseline correction was performed and the raw EEG data was used.\n",
    "The effective training and testing are done in a half-second window, starting 0.1 seconds after the start of the visual queue.\n",
    "A window of 0.5 seconds was chosen as it is a common size for sliding window approaches in online systems.\n",
    "Some alternatives to this setup were also considered, including one alternative performed for all experiment which uses a long, 1.5 seconds, window.\n",

    "   - We use the last recorded session of each of these participants, thus the one where the participant has the most experience\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We split the data in a train/test dataset with 20% test data balanced over all MI classes\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",

    "      - NOTE: participant F has three files provided but one of those files has only three MI classes rather than three, hence it is not considered here\n",
    "   - We use the last recorded session of each of these participants, thus the one where the participant has the most experience\n",
    "   - We get epochs of 3 seconds, which includes one second before and after the visual queue\n",
    "      - We use only a half a second window taking into account the online system will use sliding windows.\n",
    "      - This window starts at 0.1 seconds after then visual queue and ends at 0.6 seconds after the visual queue\n",
    "   - We split the data in a train/test dataset with 20% test data balanced over all MI classes\n",
    "   - We use the parameters for EEGNet as found in the experimental notebook `6-DL-based-classification.ipynb`:\n",
    "      - We input the raw data, which is not baseline corrected, but multiply it by 1000000 to combat the scaling that MNE does per default.\n",
    "         - This means that we only use the data from the window, so it is easier adoptable to a live setting.\n",
